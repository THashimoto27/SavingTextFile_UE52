These files are completely compatible with UE5.2 for Saving Text File C++ that is introudced by Dev Enabled on this Youtube Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZPzTN5Debc&t=596s).

# Note
On the UE 5.2, the standard compilation and live coding were not compatbile and so you need to press **CTR+ALT+F11** on the Visual Studio.
